<p class="message">
 

In short, my hobby are vices. I like to smoke, drink, crack bitter jokes and drive.
 Sarcasm is my mothertongue.
Vegetarians are a big no no. I don't like bikes. And art, and hipsters.
I like science, logic and adrenaline.
The Pro Vice Squad is me and my sarcastic soulmate. And anyone else who fits in this description.
We like life as long as we feel alive.
And we would rather die than live as vegetables.

 More to come.
