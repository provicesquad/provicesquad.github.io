I miss having my own balcony where I can go out whenever I want, sit down with my wine, smoke and look at the stars. That is when I decide to do things, I need that for my mind. Through a long and twisted series of circumstances,
that moment became part of who I am. It has a bit of everything, and it is short, like a break from everything, to remind me who I am. I do what I must, I worry and think about the future. I save money and eat right. But sometimes
I need to feel alive. Is that so hard to understand?
