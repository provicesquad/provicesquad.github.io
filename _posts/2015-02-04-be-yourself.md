title: Be yourself
---

Just because I am not like you, it doesn’t mean there is something wrong with me. I am not a psychopath and I do my work. I am nice to people, polite and considerate.
 Just because I have a strong opinion and I stand by it, it doesn’t mean I have an aggressive personality. Just because I need silence to think, it doesn’t mean I am anti social.
 In this time and age of tolerance, we surely conveniently pick our battles. It’s ok to be gay, it’s not ok to be quiet. It’s ok to be ethnic, it’s not ok to refuse social interaction.
 I see how this goes, people need someone to hate, need someone to judge. It’s ok to be yourself, but you should be more like me.
