title: Let me be

Socially developed people are evil. They are trying to be “nice” by invalidating your life values of solitude and seclusion and trying to get you to be more akin to their idol, the always cheerful, permanently socializing and eternally yapping lemur. Don't lie, everybody knows this is the idol to which all extroverts bow down. 

What they don't actually realize is that they are the ones who are flawed, because being able to live only with yourself and your thoughts for prolonged periods of time is an amazing feature of introverts. It brings us happiness. It brings us perspective. It is the power outlet of our battery. No, it does not mean we are depressed or that we hate the world (ok, maybe we do hate humans a little, but it's healthy, I swear). 

We do however detest extroverts who keep blabbering about how we don't realize being alone is bad for you and that we should change. Well, excuse me for being such an interesting person who can actually entertain itself permanently, while you get anaphylaxis the moment you realize nobody wants to hear what you have to say.

You are the weird ones, not us.
