title: Pro Vice Squad is born!
---

On this bright and sunny day of 25 January 2015 and after long struggles with reading how to websites, but mostly just a load of procrastination, [ProViceSquad](http://provicesquad.com) is finally born. Congrats to me for all my patience but most of all for not giving up.

### Bragging much?

Nope nope nope, this blog is not about bragging. It might not even be a blog in the end. This is a place of sharing honest thoughts in whichever way they get formulated in our heads. It can include any of the following:

* Ideas and mostly drunken thoughts
* Regrets
* Past stories 
* Venting
* Those things that happened and must be recorded in history
* We will see how it goes

No pressure. We are usually in a bad mood. Or depressed.
