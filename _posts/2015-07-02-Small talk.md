title: Small talk

I either have something to say or nothing at all. I am not trying to be difficult, I admire the art of small talk. 
Trying to find something to say is for me like trying to imagine a new color. 

"Da spune si tu ceva!" (Just say something!) ... Trust me, I wish I could find anything remotely interesting about your conversation that would spark an answer from me,
 I really wish I could, but it's harder than it seems.
