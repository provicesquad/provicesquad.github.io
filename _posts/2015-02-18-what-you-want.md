All I ever want sometimes is an ice cold beer. But life wouldn't be life if I could just randomly have an ice cold beer.
We have to work, yes? But fuck work, no? Wrong. You fuck work, life fucks you back.
And oh my god we have to drive the car, yes? And watch digestion. You fuck the stomach, life fucks you back.
We religiously sweat in the gym day after day. There couldn't possibly be anything better than an ice cold beer at the end, true? No, not true. Post-workout shake, or else. it. fucks. you. back.
And let's not get started on the issue of saving money and ice cold beers.
Or just living in the Middle East.
