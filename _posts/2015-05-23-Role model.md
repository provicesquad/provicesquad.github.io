title: Role model
---

I remember the first and only role model I have found in my life. When I was a little girl, I used to watch Xena The Warrior Princess, I adored her. She
was nothing like anything else I had seen in TV or in the real world. She was a strong, confident woman who fought for justice with endless courage. She
was kind and compassionate towards the innocent, she was wise and she was inspiring. I found myself in her immediately, she was who I felt I wanted to be.
I believe every little girl should watch Xena, they all should know they have this choice. And if they have it inside, they will live up to it.

Sometimes it takes a pair of piercing cold blue eyes to see it clearly. To know that who you feel you are is not wrong. It's ok to be different, it can
be glorious. If you want to be on the fighting side, and you cannot find it in reality around you, it's good enough if you can find it in fiction. 

When I was little, I was not afraid. I was never afraid of anything. I used to come home covered in bruises, looking forward to go back. I used to defend
cat and dogs from mean boys. I wish I could be now, what I used to be back then.
