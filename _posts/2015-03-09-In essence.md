What irritates me:
*bad smells
*theatrical/overused expressions
*pretentious art
*repetitive loud noises
*things that don’t make sense
*the presence of children
*long in depth discussions about things that I don’t care about
*hearing people bragging about anything
*condescending compliments
*being touched by strangers/people who are not close to me
*comments about my hair ( nr 1 in the list, might trigger a murder soon)
*witnessing weakness in other people
*being woken up for no good reason
*being hurried/having to hurry
*waiting until the last minute before getting into a train
*vegetarians/diet freaks
*unwanted sunrays
*bikes
*crowds
*people that:
	- are late constantly
    - feel important 
    - dislike animals
    - criticize me
    - brag, laugh loudly, speak a lot, smile fakely 
    - demand attention or/and want to dominate
    - are dirty 
    - try to impose their opinions on other people ( nr 2 on the list )
    - speak about things they do not understand/ have only a vague idea about
    - are close minded / too religious / stuck up / pretentious 
    - feel superior
    - lie / manipulate  
    - try to speak to me when I have headphones on
    - tell me to say something / ask me why I am so quiet ( nr zero …)
    - try to teach me how to not be shy against my will
    - think that being more like them means being better
    - expect me to want to do what they want to do
    - feel sorry for me when I tell them I like being alone ( just die please, thank you)
    - judge me without making an effort to understand me first
